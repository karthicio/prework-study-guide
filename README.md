# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was an effort to expand personal knowledge involving the basic steps involved behind four basic aspects involved in coding of a webpage
respectively being, HTML, CCS, Git, and Javascript. This helped to provide the fundamental basics of these four parts involved in creating a development project
such as this and modifying and maintaining it to ensure we would be ready to begin the coding bootcamp ready to begin developing these basics. 

Using the starte code provided by the bootcamp, a github repository was setup and used to house the reference main files.
This repository was then connected to our local development environment via an SSH connection.
Next our local files were moddfied and added to until they ultimately reached the state seen in the repository.
